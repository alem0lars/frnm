Easy file renamer - It just provides a couple of specific utilities to common rename operations in UNIX-like environments - Don't expect too much :)

## Notes

At the moment, the scripts performs a numeric swap (useful in `conf.d`, etc..).
However customizing the launch step, you can perform different renames, customizing the parameters sent to functions like: `rename`, `swap`, etc..
