Easy file renamer - It just provides a couple of specific utilities to common rename operations in UNIX-like environments - Don't expect too much :)

*This script isn't meant to be used as standalone script but as a collection of renaming functions and snippets that you can customize based on your needs.*

## Notes

At the moment, the scripts performs a numeric swap (useful in `conf.d`, etc..).
However customizing the launch step, you can perform different renames, customizing the parameters sent to functions like: `rename`, `swap`, etc..

## No warranty

I've created this script for my daily sysadmin operations. I don't expect you use it. If you use it do at your own risk.
